Heart Stroke Prediction Resampling Techniques

the following resampling techniques are used to address class imbalance in the heart stroke prediction dataset:

Oversampling Techniques:
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach for Imbalanced Learning)
Undersampling Techniques:
Random UnderSampling (RUS)
NearMiss Algorithm
Hybrid Techniques (Combination of Over- and Under-sampling):

SMOTEENN (SMOTE + Edited Nearest Neighbors)
These techniques were evaluated using multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and KNN.
